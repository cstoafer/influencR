To help fight back.  Influenced by the [article by Andy Moon](https://medium.com/@andymoon/how-we-can-fight-back-c1c3605c57ad#.jch2zel09).

Goal: Create a simple Heroku app to serve user's contact information for their representatives, current issues in that state/district, and a script that the user can use to call their representatives.
